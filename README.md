## Differences Between RazzShell and Other Shells

RazzShell distinguishes itself from other Unix shells like Bash, Zsh, and Fish by offering:

- **Unique Command Names**: RazzShell uses custom names for its built-in commands (e.g., `change` instead of `cd`, `list` instead of `ls`). This encourages users to learn and use the shell's unique features.
- **Enhanced Visuals**: With colorful output for directory listings and error messages, RazzShell provides a more visually engaging experience compared to traditional shells.
- **Integrated Features**: RazzShell incorporates features like bookmarking commands, visualizing command flow, and session management directly into the shell without requiring additional scripting or plugins.
- **Simplified Command Set**: By providing a curated set of built-in commands, RazzShell aims to simplify command usage, making it more approachable for new users.
- **Consistent Behavior**: Custom commands are designed to behave consistently across different systems, reducing discrepancies that might occur with external commands in other shells.
- **Root Shell Integration**: RazzShell allows users to elevate to a root shell within the shell itself, maintaining the shell environment and features.
